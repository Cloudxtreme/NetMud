-1 MARRY MARRIAGE SPOUSE SPOUSETALK DIVORCE~
Ah, the beautiful ceremony that occurs when someone loves another so much
that they wish to spend the rest of their lives together.  Unfortuneately,
it turns sour sometimes.  Whether you're wanting to marry, or be divorced,
it must be performed by an Immortal.  With marriage, comes the ability
to communicate exclusively to your spouse via your own private talkline.

213 IMC~
IMC (Inter-Mud Communication) provides a way for muds to connect together and
share various services: chat channels, tells, notes, who listings, and so on.

The available mortal-level IMC commands are as follows. See the help topics
for each of these for more information.

- IMCLIST : get a list of active muds that are connected to IMC.
- RCHAT   : send a message on the common chat channel.
- RWHO    : send a who request to a mud.
- RTELL   : send a tell to someone on another mud.
- RREPLY  : reply to a rtell from someone on another mud.
- RQUERY  : ask for information of some type from another mud.
- RBEEP   : "beep" another player. Use sparingly.
- RWHOIS  : find someone on IMC
- RFINGER : get information about a player on another mud
- ISTATS  : get some (interesting?) stats about IMC.
- RCHAN   : show which channels you are listening to, and modify that state.

There is also provision for inter-mud notes/mail; see 'IMC NOTES'.

213 IMCLIST~
Syntax:  imclist                  - get a list of active muds on IMC
         imclist direct           - get a list of directly connected muds
         imclist config           - see the local IMC config

'imclist' lists active muds on IMC. It lists all the muds which this mud knows
about on the IMC network, and when they were last heard from. The 'route'
section is mainly for diagnostics, and indicates the route that your mud will
send packets via to get to another mud.

'imclist direct' shows direct connections from your mud to other muds.

'imclist config' shows the local IMC configuration and state.

213 RCHAT RIMM RCODE~
These channels are obselete, use ICE instead.
~
213 RWHO~
Syntax:  rwho <mudname>               - ask for a who listing from another mud

'rwho' asks the given mud for a 'who' listing of its current players. Depending
on the network, it may take several seconds to get a response. You should use
the mud abbreviation listed in 'imclist' when issuing a rwho.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RQUERY RWHOIS
~
213 RWHOIS~
Syntax:  rwhois <playername>          - find a player on IMC

'rwhois' asks all muds on IMC for a player with the given name. You should not
include a @mudname section - just the playername. Replies will be returned
from those muds who have a player by that name connected.

See also: IMC RWHO RFINGER
~
213 RFINGER~
Syntax:  rfinger <player@mudname>     - get information about a player

'rfinger' asks the specified mud for information about the specified player.
The information you will get back (and even its existance) depends on the
remote mud, but will typically give at least their last login time.

See also: IMC RWHO RWHOIS
~
0 RTELL RREPLY~
Syntax:  rtell <player@mudname> <message>    - send a 'tell' to another player
         rreply <message>                    - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                               to send you a rtell

rtell and rreply are the IMC equivalents of tell and reply, and work nearly
identically. To rtell, however, you need to supply both a playername and a
mudname (as shown in 'imclist'). rreply will reply to the last rtell you
received from a player - even if that player was invisible to you.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
~
213 RQUERY~
Syntax:  rquery <mudname> help         - ask for available rquery options
         rquery <mudname> <option>     - ask for information from a mud

RQuery is similar to rwho, except it requests different information from a
mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies, but 'rquery <mudname>
help' will give you a list of options that you can ask for.

Typically at least the following are supported:

rquery <mud> who        - ask for a who listing, identical to 'rwho'
rquery <mud> info       - get general information on the mud, usually including
                          its address. This is the preferred way of finding
                          out the address of a mud on IMC - don't ask on rchat!
rquery <mud> list       - ask for a list of IMC connections, from that mud's
                          point of view. Identical to 'imclist' on the remote
                          mud.
rquery <mud> istats     - ask for some IMC statistics, identical to 'istats' on
                          the remote mud.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RWHO
~
213 RBEEP~
Syntax:  rbeep <player@mudname>     - "beep" a player over IMC

rbeep sends an audible beep to another player on another mud (the @mudname
part indicates which mud; see 'imclist'). Note that this should only be done
when you _really_ need to get their attention; abusing rbeep will usually
lead to your IMC priviliges being revoked.

See also: IMC IMCLIST
~
213 ISTATS~
Syntax:  istats                     - display use(less?) statistics

istats shows some (maybe :) interesting statistics about how much traffic your
mud is generating due to IMC.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RQUERY
~
213 RCHANNELS RCHAN RINVIS~
Syntax:  rchannels                  - display your current IMC channel state
         rchannels +<channel>       - turn on an IMC channel
         rchannels -<channel>       - turn off an IMC channel

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.

rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.

rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.

One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.

Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

See also: IMC RCHAT RBEEP RTELL
~
213 'IMC NOTES'~
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.

For example, you may be able to do:

note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud

and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'

The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.

If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

~
213 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RINFO~
IMC Immortal commands:

- RINFO       : A channel which the various hubs put status reports onto. Can
                be spammy at times; you may want to turn off rinfo for this
                reason.
- RSOCKETS    : displays debugging info on the current IMC connection state.
- RCONNECT    : force a connection to a directly connected mud.
- RDISCONNECT : forcibly disconnect a directly connected mud.
- RIGNORE     : ignore a player or an entire mud on IMC.
- MAILQUEUE   : show the current queue of pending inter-mud notes.
- IMC         : edit the IMC configuration for your mud (see 'IMC CONFIG')
- RCHANSET    : manage access to IMC channels/rtell/rbeep for players.
- RPING       : trace IMC connectivity

See also: IMC
~
213 RSOCKETS~
Syntax:  rsockets                   - display IMC socket usage

rsockets displays the current connection state for the direct IMC connections
that your mud has. The various fields are:

Desc  : the system-level descriptor used for this connection

Mud   : which mud this connection is for

State : how far through the connection process this connection is:
        - connecting: waiting for the other end to accept our TCP connection
        - wait1:      waiting for the password from an incoming client
        - wait2:      waiting for the server to respond to our password
        - connected:  the connection is completely 'up'

Inbuf : the size of data waiting in the input and output queues for this
Outbuf: connection.

Spam1 : spam-protection counters
Spam2 :

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS'
~
213 RCONNECT~
Syntax:  rconnect <mudname>                - start an IMC connection

rconnect will initiate a connection to the given mud. Note that this has to
be a _directly_ connected mud (ie. a mud in the first section of imclist).
Feedback on the state of the connection will be logged to 'wiznet imc', and 
you may want to check imclist to see if it was successful.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL' RDISCONNECT
~
213 RDISCONNECT~
Syntax:  rdisconnect <mudname>             - terminate an IMC connection

rdisconnect reverses rconnect, severing all connections to the named mud.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RCONNECT
~
213 RIGNORE~
Syntax:  rignore                           - list current rignores
         rignore ignore  <pattern>         - ignore player(s) or mud(s)
         rignore notrust <pattern>         - don't trust player(s) or mud(s)
	 rignore delete  <pattern>         - remove a rignore

rignore ignores or restricts the access, at a mud-wide level, everything
coming in over IMC for a specified player or group of players. Currently
two possible actions are possible: ignore and notrust.

Ignore means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

Notrust means:

- any rwho/rfinger/etc requests from a mud/player matching the pattern will
  be treated as if they were from a level 1 mortal - ie. wizi imms will never
  be revealed on rwho, and rtells won't see them, etc.
- any incoming channel messages from something matching the pattern are
  stripped of wizi status - they will be visible to everyone in general.

Patterns can be one of:

  player@mud              - matches a specific player at a specific mud
  *suffix                 - matches anything ending with that suffix
                            (commonly used as *@mud)
  prefix*                 - matches anything beginning with that prefix
                            (for example, player@*)
  *substring*             - matches anything containing that substring

Use with care.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS'
~
213 MAILQUEUE~
Syntax:  mailqueue                         - show current IMC mailqueue

This command simply shows the current contents of the outgoing IMC mailqueue
for inter-mud notes. Due to the internal implementation of this (static
buffers - ick), only the first 8-9 entries will be shown.

See also: IMC 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' 'IMC NOTES'
~
213 RCHANSET~
Syntax:  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

~
213 'IMC CONFIG'~
The 'imc' command is used to configure your IMC setup:

Syntax:  imc add <mudname>            - add a new IMC connection entry
         imc set <...>                - set the details of an IMC connection
         imc delete <mudname>         - remove an IMC connection
         imc rename <old> <new>       - rename an IMC connection
         imc reload                   - load a new IMC config file from disk
         imc localname <name>         - set the local IMC name
         imc localport <port>         - set the local IMC port

Add, delete, and rename should be self-explanatory. The name of an IMC
connection MUST match the name which the other end is using.

Reload destroys the version of the configuration in memory, and reloads it
from disk. This is useful if you have hand-edited the config file and want
to load your changes without rebooting. 'imc reload' also reloads the
rignores file.

The set command has several forms:

imc set <mudname> all <data...>     - set all values for a mud
                  host <hostname>   - set the hostname to connect to
                  port <portnum>    - set the remote IMC port to connect to
                  clientpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive client password
                  serverpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive server password
                  rcvstamp <value>  - set the receivestamp
                  noforward <value> - set the noforward bitmask
                  flags <value>     - set the connection flags

The 'all' form takes a series of values:

imc set <mudname> all <host> <port> <clientpw> <serverpw> <rcvstamp>
                      <noforward> <flags>

For information on the exact details of each field, see the IMC documentation.

The localname and localport commands set the IMC name and port of -your- mud.
Use with care.

~
213 ICE~
ICE - the IMC Channel Extensions protocol

ICE is a response to the cesspool-like attributes that rchat, rimm, and
even rcode have acquired over the last few months. It is IRC-ish in some
ways, but hopefully it will be used more constructively than IRC.

For a quick introduction and setup guide for ICE, see ICE-INTRO

The basic ICE structure is (greatly simplified):

. Some nodes on IMC - normally hubs - run channel daemon code that
  manages channels
. Each of these nodes maintains a list of the channels they manage, and
  the various attributes of them - who owns them, and so on
. The daemons regularly tell all muds on IMC what channels they have, and
  what their attributes are
. Based on this information, the muds on IMC decide which of their local
  users can use which ICE channels. If one mud is modified to ignore these
  restrictions, then the other muds will recognize this (since they, too,
  know the restrictions) and ignore messages from that mud.

Every channel on ICE is of the form nodename:channelname, for example a
channel called hub2:IAdmin is the channel IAdmin maintained by the node hub2.
Each mud picks which channels it is interested in (see ILIST and
ISETUP) and creates a local channel name which can be used to talk on
that channel.

Generally, any admin on a mud can create a channel on any node - although
nodes can be configured to restrict who can create channels. Whoever
creates a channel owns it, and can control who can use that channel (in
whatever way they wish). The trick, of course, is to persuade the admins
of other muds that your channel has value. Creating and modifying a
channel is done via the ICOMMAND command.

Channels can be tuned into and out of on a player-by-player basis by
using the ICHAN command.

There are a variety of ways of controlling who can hear and use a channel
- see ICE-POLICY for more information.

213 ICE-INTRO~
A Quick Introduction to ICE

This assumes that the code for IMC and ICE is installed and running, and
that you have an active connection to an IMC network.

1. ILIST. This will give you a list of possible channels to choose from.
   Pick one that you want to add, that has a policy of 'open'. Note its
   name (of the form node:channel).

2. Decide what command you want to use to speak on this channel on your
   mud. This is the channel's localname.

3. Type: ISETUP ADD <node:channel> <localname>

4. You should now be able to use the channel. Others can listen to and
   speak on the channel by using ICHAN <localname>.

5. You may wish to reconfigure the default local channel settings.
   ILIST <localname> will display them; ISETUP will change them.

6. Repeat for whatever other channels you wish to have.

See also: IMC ICE ISETUP ICOMMAND ICHAN ILIST
~
213 ICHAN~
Syntax:  ichan               - display current ICE channel status
         ichan <localname>   - toggle an ICE channel

IChan lets you show and toggle which ICE channels you are listening
to. Without arguments, it will show you the channels you belog to; with
an argument, it will turn on or off that channel.

Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
ISETUP. ILIST can be used to see available channels.

See also: IMC ICE ILIST ISETUP
~
213 ICOMMAND~
Syntax:          icommand <command> <channel> [<data..>]
Common commands:  create <channel>           - create a channel
                  refresh <channel>          - refresh channel data
                  list [<channel>]           - list available commands
                  destroy <channel>          - destroy a channel
                  policy <channel> <policy>  - change channel policy
                  addop <channel> <name>     - add a channel operator
                  removeop <channel> <name>  - remove an operator
                  invite <channel> <name>    - add an invited name
                  uninvite <channel> <name>  - remove an invited name
                  exclude <channel> <name>   - exclude a name
                  unexclude <channel> <name> - remove an exclusion

ICommand is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.

Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
icommand list <nodename> for public commands, or icommand list
<node:channel> to see what commands you have for that channel.

icommand refresh asks the daemon to refresh your mud's information for a
channel, if it ever gets out of synx. Asking for a refresh of nodename:*
will refresh all channels on that daemon.

icommand create creates a new channel, with you as the owner
icommand destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.

icommand policy changes the basic policy of the channel (see ICE-POLICY).
You must be the owner.

icommand addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.

icommand invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the channel.
Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be specified.
See ICE-POLICY for more details.

~
213 ISETUP~
Syntax: isetup add <ice-channel> <localname>   - add a channel
        isetup delete <localname>              - delete a channel
        isetup rename <oldname> <newname>      - rename a channel
        isetup format1 <localname> <format>    - change format1 on a channel
        isetup format2 <localname> <format>    - change format2 on a channel
        isetup level <localname> <level>       - set channel level

ISetup allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.

ISetup add begins the configuration of a channel. It connects the
specified ice-channel (of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.
For example: isetup add hub2:IAdmin IAdmin. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.

When the channel is added, various default values are filled in for
format1, format2, and level.

ISetup delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.

ISetup rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.

ISetup format1 and format2 change how a channel is displayed locally.
Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it (this is checked
for) - the first will be replaced by the speaker's name, the second by
whatever they say. Format1 is used for normal speech, format2 for emotes.
See ILIST for more information.

ISetup level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.

See also: IMC ICE ILIST
~
213 ILIST~
Syntax:  ilist               - list all known ICE channels
         ilist <channel>     - list details on one ICE channel

IList displays information on channels active on ICE.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Policy
hub2:IAdmin     IAdmin          Nemon@AR        open
hub2:ICode      ICode                                    (inactive)
hub2:test       (not local)     Nemon@ARtest    private

This shows the canonical name (eg. hub2:IAdmin), the local name (eg IAdmin
- which can be used as an abbreviation in ISETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel (eg.
Nemon@AR), and the channel's policy (see ICE-POLICY).

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its
local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC, it
will have an (inactive) flag on it.

IList with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel hub2:IAdmin:
  Local name: IAdmin
  Format 1:   (IAdmin) %s: %s
  Format 2:   (IAdmin) %s %s
  Level:      102

  Policy:     open
  Owner:      Nemon@AR
  Operators:  Drylock@AR
  Invited:    NiceGuy@SomeMud
  Excluded:   SomeMud

This displays the channel name, local name, policy, and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- the minimum level needed on your mud to see the channel

- the format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc. that your mud uses.

  Format1 is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Format2 is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their name,
  the second %s the text of their emote.

- any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the ISETUP command.

- the invited and excluded people on the channel. See ICE-POLICY for
  more details.

~
-213 ICE-POLICY~
ICE Channel Policies

Channels can have one of three policies - open, closed, and private. They
also have one owner, and zero or more operators (assigned by the owner).
They also have an include and exclude list (which can specify both
individual players ['user@mud'] and entire muds ['mud']), which can be
modified by the owner and the operators.

- Open. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel). People on the exclude list cannot use the channel,
  with the exception of people also on the invite list. This means, for
  example, if an entire mud is excluded and one player is invited, that
  player can use the channel, but the rest of the mud can't.

- Closed. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel), but by default they will not hear or be able to use
  it. People on the invite list can use the channel, with the exception of
  people also on the exclude list.

- Private. Identical to closed, except that the channel is actually only
  physically sent to those muds that are on the invite list. This is good
  for channels specific to a small group of muds, and not of interest to

You cannot accept a challenge while in hell or jail, or fighting. 
If you have the required amount of coins being challenged, you will both
be transported to the arena.

~
0 SCRY~
&RSyntax: &Bcast &Pscry&W
 
Scry is a spell which once cast, allows you to see into rooms directly around you.
Once casted, if you type look in a direction it will give you the view of that area
as if you were actually there.  You will see any objects in the room as well as it's 
occupants.  It is a form of astral projection.
~
0 !~
&RSyntax:&B &w!

! repeats the last command you typed.
~
0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
&RSyntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>&w

&BBUY&w buys an object from a shop keeper.

&BLIST&w with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
&BLIST&w <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

&BSELL&w sells an object to a shop keeper.

&BVALUE&w asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

&BBUY&w, &BSELL&w, and &BVALUE&w, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if &BLIST DAGGER&w showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~
0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~
0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells and SING for bards.
~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

COINS being one of gold, silver or copper.
DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt 
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~

Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~
0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

they will no longer follow your orders.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
&RSyntax: &Brest&W
&RSyntax: &Bsleep&W
&RSyntax: &Bstand&W
&RSyntax: &Bwake&W

you won't hear many things happen
 
Use &BSTAND&W or &BWAKE&W to come back to a standing position.
 
&RSyntax: &Bwake  &Gcharacter&W
 
You can also &BWAKE&W other sleeping characters by using this command,
 
You may also rest or sleep on something. One person at a time may rest
on a chair, many on a sofa, and one person may sleep on a bed.
Resting and sleeping on furniture increases your regen.

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.

&PWEAR&W is for armor.  &PWIELD&W is for weapons.
 
&PWEAR ALL&W will attempt to &PHOLD, WEAR,&W or &PWIELD&W each suitable item in your
inventory.  You may not be able to &PHOLD,WEAR,&W or &PWIELD&W an item if its alignment
does not match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced
enough to use it properly.
Your class and race may also affect the "&Rwearability&W" of any item or piece
of equipment.

0 DEATH~
&WPlease read this, and keep all in mind. For short version see "help death2".&w
When your character dies, you are reincarnated persay. This is, of course,
depending on the level of your character at the time of death.
 
If you die AT or UNDER LEVEL 20, you and your corpse will be transferred to
the morgue. Here you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. 
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 at the time of death, you will be sent to the morgue.
That is, your mind and soul will be transferred to the morgue where it will
have to seek out and find your body to join with once again. Of course, if
you have no luck in finding your corpse you will have to re-equip yourself
with no armour to aid you.
 
The Gods have been known to grant favors for mortals who are reknown for great
deed-doing (helping newbies, and helping others retrieve lost corpses). To
expect such a favor is sacriledge, and to receive one... a great honor.
 
** Any affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.**
**Followers and group members are not affected by death**
**You lose experience points for dying. You lose half-way back to the
  beginning of your level.**
**All followers are lost upon your death. (or theirs)**
&R***&WCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last -roughly- 30 hours of MUD time (15 minutes real time). Only
the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects from a
player's corpse.&R***&w
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    killing monsters
    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~
0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

When an area resets, you are often notified with what is called the "area
sound". Usually some theme to the area. Again, some areas have no sound and
you will not be physically warned of a reset.
~
0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~
0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
~
0 'CONSIDER'~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well as
a comparison of your relative health. Consider takes into account
all damage shields (ie iceshield), all types of sanc spells
and whether or not the victim is wielding a weapon.

to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

Also see &BBASH&W for warriors.
~
0 DRINK~

you might die of &Pdehydration&W.  Remember always keep you fluids
up!
 
~
0 SACRIFICE~
&BSyntax: &Wsacrifice <object>
 
SACRIFICE offers an object to your God.  God may &Preward &Wyou for the 
sacrifice.  The nature of the reward &Pdepends &Wupon the type of object.
&RHint:&W God likes corpses.
 
~
0 FLEE~
&BSyntax: &Wflee
 
Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can &Pattempt&W to FLEE.  All this means is that instead
of fighting, you turn tail and haul ass.  Flee &Pdoes not always work&W and you
will lose experience for succeeding or failing for showing such cowardice.
 
~
0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
&BSyntax:&W bash <direction>
 
A powerful warrior can attempt to &Pbypass&W the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly &Paggressive&W action, and
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
 
~
0 CHAMELEON 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
&BSyntax: &Wchameleon
 
With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to &Pchange&W
the appearance and coloration of his or her body, armor, and equipment to
blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective if the
psionicist remains &Pabsolutely still&W.
 
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~
&BSyntax: &Wfollow <character>
&BSyntax: &Wgroup
&BSyntax: &Wgroup <character>
 
FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.
 
GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.
 
If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
 
GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
&RNOTE:&W You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
 
~
0 HEIGHTEN 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
&BSyntax: &Wheighten
 
A psionicist is able to heighten there senses some times.  When they do this, 
they have the ability to &Pdetect&W things that would otherwise go unnoticed.  
So in other words, they become more &Palert&W, etc.
 
~
0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
&BSyntax: &WHIDE
&BSyntax: &WSNEAK
&BSyntax: &WVISIBLE
 
The skill hide, is used by a lot of thieves.  Many times they have to &Phide&W
when a storekeeper (or someone else they robbed), is chasing after them
calling for the police.  If done properly most people &Pcannot see you&W.
 
Sometimes you must also try to sneak out of a room when &Phiding&W.  If you
sneak &Pproperly&W, most people will not be able to see you and hear you when
you leave.
 
If you must become &Pvisible&W again, type visible and it &Pcancels&W you hiding and
sneaking. It also cancels almost any invisibility routine.
 
~
0 'POISON WEAPON'~
&RSyntax: &Bpoison &Gweapon&W
 
With this skill, a thief can create a &Pdeadly&W poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires &Pspecial ingredients&W, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.
 
&RCaution:&W The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.
 
~
0 PRACTICE~
&BSyntax: &WPRACTICE
&BSyntax: &WPRACTICE <skill|spell>
 
PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 
100%, depending on your class.  You must be at a &PGUILDMASTER &Wto 
practice.
 
The higher your &Pintelligence&W, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your &Pwisdom&W, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
&BSyntax:&W QUIT
&BSyntax:&W SAVE
 
SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save. The game will &Pauto-save&W your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.
 
&RNOTE: &WSome objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, 
may not be saved.
 
 
QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere. When you return to the
game, you will find yourself in the room you last quit in.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can &Psafely &Wleave the game with just one
command. Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to &Pregret &Wit
 
&RNOTE: &WThere is no RENT on this MUD.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you 
want to leave.
 
~
0 RECALL 'RECITE RECALL'~
Syntax: RECALL
Syntax: RECITE RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
your Temple. RECITE RECALL works only when you have a scroll of recall,
and you must have practiced the appropriate skill for scrolls.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse will not recall at all.
~
0 SHADOW 'SHADOW FORM'~
Syntax: shadow

A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows while 
moving, having the same effect as the thief skill SNEAK.  See also VISIBLE.

will cost.

For a list of ALL available spells for your class, type SLIST.
~
0 SPLIT~

using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana points, and movement points.  Each
of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable gain.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more

WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.

of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.

0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'
  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'thought shield'&W
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'mental barrier'&W
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'displacement'&W
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'flesh armor'&W
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'intellect fortress'&W
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'inertial barrier&W
 
These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

&PTHOUGHT SHIELD&W and &PMENTAL BARRIER&W create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the power of the psionicist's will.
 
&PDISPLACEMENT&W makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position.  They are then more difficult to hit.  A good defensive spell.

With the &PFLESH ARMOR&W devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an 
armor-like substance. This protects them from the attacks of others.

&PINTELLECT FORTRESS&W shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

&PINERTIAL BARRIER&W creates a barrier of &Rpositive&W energy that reduces the damage
inflicted by creatures of &Bnegative&W energy.
 
~
0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended 
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~
0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or 
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of 
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~
0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy 
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~
0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
&RSyntax: &Bcast &P'enhance armor' &G<object>&W

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects, 
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.
~
0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~
0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~
0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.

-1 MOTD~
Weclome to PaP, I'm Flux, the new administrator and owner of the code.
There are few changes to Swift's original coding plan.
 
I trimmed the class list and race list down a bit and changed added some
races as well. Humans now have the ability/chance to evolve into higher
beings. Those are listed as the XXXXsapiens, aquasapien, chrono and avia.
I finished masquerade coding, at least the base part of it.
 
I added a weapon class function, this replaces the old defunct dam noun stuff.
now U must set the weapon class (what type of dam it deals) and u can set
the damage noun seperatly, please dont make pierce class weapons with the
strike or bash noun, thats just silly.
 
For all other changes, see the help additions file.

I plan to go beta stage in late august, for the arrival of school year.
Hopefully we have enough areas by then.
 
You can save at level one, so dont worry about levelling to save a file.
 
Other than that, have fun ;).

51 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of PaP **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)
~
-1 RULES~
These are the rules of PaP.  For other matters, use commom sense.

* foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on PaP, from anyone
  (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.

* sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by deletion

* your presence here is a privilige not a right
 
* no multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* no kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is 
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.
  You risk deletion should you be caught.
 
* Absolutely NO summonsing any mobs to the main Prison complex.  I do NOT
   wish newbies jeopardized.  There's plenty of room outside those towns,
   use them.
 
~
-1 STORY~
In the beginning, the earth was... oh too far back.
*crumbles up help file and throws it away*
~
0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~
51 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The spells command is used to display your character's list of available
skills and spells.  Slist will also show you all skills and spells available
to your character.  Skills and spells are listed showing amount of pts
(points) it costs for each particular one, when you type spells.  
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist), typing it again removes
it. 
~
-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
206 HEDIT~
&BSyntax: &Whedit create <keywords>
&BSyntax: &Whedit <keywords>
 
&Glevel <value>&W           - The level required to access this help 
&Gkeyword <words>&W         - The words used to access the help file
&Gdesc&W                    - Accesses the text editor to alter the body of the help file
 
&GBe careful with the keywords in a help file.
All keywords should be written in capital letters, all caps for all the letters.
If it is a phrase with multiple words, such as a spell name,
put apostrophies around the whole phrase.
~
205 ARGLIST~
The mobprog arglist changes from type to type.
For most types it is a percentage (1-100), and on others it is keywords
or an ammount.
I.e., for the hit_prcnt_prog, it's a percentage.. namely if the arglist is 30,
then when the mobs hp is at 30% or less of max, then the prog is triggered.
For give_prog, the arglist is all the keywords of the object to trigger that program
when the object is given to the mob.
And for all_greet_prog, arglist is a percentage, 100 will make the prog run
whenever anyone enters the room (excluding invis imms).
~
206 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict [commandname] [level]
Syntax: restrict [commandname] log [logtype]
 
Commandname is the name of the command you wish to change the level or
logtype of, you can use shortforms of commands giving there aren't any
other commands with those sames letters or you may not get the one you
wish. :)  Logtype is the type of logging you wish a command to have,
type restrict by itself for quick syntax and the logtypes.  Also,
it is possible to type:  restrict all [firstcmd#] [secondcmd#]
for a listing of commands and the levels which they are currently at.
Firstcmd# is the first command you wish to list from, and secondcmd#
is the number of the command you wish to list to.
~
201 WRLIST~
Syntax: wrlist [type(r/o/m/p)] [lvnum] [uvnum]
 
Wrlist lists the vnums and names of the items in those vnums.  You can list
room vnums and their names with r, objects with o, and mobs with m.  When
listing rooms, it also shows you the resets in each room.  Lvnum is the
beginning vnum you wish to list from, and uvnum is the ending vnum.
Note, with m, if the mob has mobprogs, it will list each of the
different types of mobprogs the mob has.  P will list all the mobs with
mobprogs within the range.  It will show the full mobprog: type, arglist,
AND comlist, unlike with m.
 
When checking for progs (p) using wrlist, please only use a maximum vnum
range of about 25 at a time, or the Mud will crash due to spamming.
~
206 VUSED~
Vused simply lists all the blocks of vnums which have been created to date.
The last line it shows tells you just how many free vnums there are. :)
~
205 VARIABLES~
Here is a list of variables that can possibly be used in most mobprog commands
, etc.
 $i   the name of the mob being triggered
 $I   the mobs short description
 $n   the name of the mob/pc triggering the mobprog
 $N   the short description of the person triggering the mobprog if it
      is a mob, or the name of the trigger person plus their title if it
      is a pc
 $t   the name of the victim
 $T   the same as $N except for the victim
 $r   the name of a pc/npc taken from random in the room
 $R   the same as $N except the random person is used

higher, otherwise you will eternally lose concentration.  Spell casting costs
vampires blood points, and with all other spell casting classes it costs mana.
How much mana or how many blood points it takes, is mainly dependant on what
kind of spell it is and how many levels you have been able to practice it.  As
you gain levels, spells that you had on previous levels will drop in mana/bp
cost.  To see how much mana/bp your currently practiced spells will
cost to cast, you may type SPELLS.  Typing PRACTICE will list all currently

205 PARAMTYPES PTYPES~
All x_progs are triggered by certain actions, and then are passed through
a check to see if the trigger is activated.  There are various types
of parameters based on these checks, which are compared to the information
received by the game driver.
 
Percent Parameters:
  These are the most common kind of checks.  The parameter is a number
between 0 and 100, 0 meaning the trigger will never activate, and 100
meaning the trigger will activated every time it is called.
 
Word Parameters:
  These parameters may be specified in one of two ways: As a word list or
as a phrase.  As a word list, each word of the parameter is check against
each word of the incoming data, and if any of the words match, the trigger
will be activated.  A phrase parameter starts off with the letter 'p' as
the first word, followed by the phrase to be compared.  In a phrase, all
words compared much match (excluding the initial 'p').
 
Slot Parameters:
  These indicate a spell slot.  Spell slots may be found by using the
'slookup' command.  Be careful to use the SLOT and not the SN, as they
are two different numbers, used for different purposes.
 
Hour Parameters:
  This type takes two arguments: The starting hour and the finishing
hour.  These are called every game hour, and if the time is between the
two numbers, the trigger will activate.  Numbers must be in 24 hour format,
and may wrap around midnight.  (ie: '20 8' would activate every hour between
8:00pm and 8:00am, game time, every game night.)
 
Hitpoints Parameters:
  The parameters for this trigger is a number between 0 and 100, indicating
the percentage of hitpoints the mob has from its max hitpoints.  The trigger
is activated when the mobile's hitpoints to max hitpoints percentage fall
below the specified percentage.
 
Itemlist Parameters:
  This is a list of items which may activate the trigger.  Use quotation
marks (' or ") if you wish to use items with more than one keyword.
eg: 'orange dagger' as opposed to orange dagger.  The first example would
need an item with both names to activate the trigger, and the second
example would need an item with either name to activate.
 
Goldpieces Parameters:
  The ammount specified in the single parameter is the minimum ammount
of gold needed to activate the trigger.
~
201 MVARS MVARIABLES~
All mob_progs may use the following variables:
  $i, $n, $r, and modifications of these (like $e for $n)
 
prog name      | param type | useable variables
---------------+------------+------------------
act_prog       | word       | see below
speech_prog    | word       | (none)
rand_prog      | percent    | (none)
fight_prog     | percent    | (none)
death_prog     | percent    | (none)
hitprcnt_prog  | hitpoints  | (none)
entry_prog     | percent    | (none)
greet_prog     | percent    | (none)
all_greet_prog | percent    | (none)
give_prog      | itemlist   | $o
bribe_prog     | goldpieces | (none)
 
Note: rand_prog and entry_prog do *NOT* have a $n variable available.
 
For act_prog, the variables depend on the information received
Any action that involves an object may use $o.
Any action that involves two or more objects may use $o and $p.
Any action that involves a third party may use $t.
These actions do not have to be done by the programmed mobile.
ie: A person types 'give <object> <target>'.  $o becomes <object>, and
$t becomes <target>.  $t may be the same as $i if the mobile itself is
the target of the action.

0 ANIMATE DEAD~

0 ASTRAL WALK~
Syntax: cast 'astral walk' <intended name of mob or character>
 
This spell enables the caster to 'astral' (automatically go) to an intended
location anywhere in PaP.  As long as the area will allow you to

~
1 NEWBIE~
To the absolute beginner:
 
Welcome to PaP.  PaP is a multi user Dungeon game or Mud for
short.  If you have gotten this far you have already chosen your race and
class.  Those choices you have made have created the character you are now
controlling.  You can make your character do almost anything by using a command
and pressing enter.  If your screen scrolls while you are typing just continue
to enter your command the mud will understand you.
 
 
Some commands to get you going are as follows:
   >look           and also 'look in <item>'
   >say            followed by the sentence you wish to say
   >who will show all visible players.
   >tell <person> and what you want to tell a person.
   >chat and what you want the world to hear.
   >exits          will reveal all obvious exits from the room you are in
   >north          will take you to the north if you can go there
   >south          -------------------- south -------------------
   >east           -------------------- east  -------------------
   >up             --------------------  up   -------------------
   >down           -------------------- down  -------------------
   >inventory      lists the items you carry
   >equipment      lists the items you are using
   >get <item>     to pick up an item
   >score          gives you your current score.
   >save saves your char and equipment.
   >quit  quits the game.
 
All commands can be abbreviated.  Thus the command 'look' can be abbreviated to
just 'l'.  Names of things and items can NOT be abbreviated, you must write
their full name to refer to them.  Be careful! Learn which abbreviations trigger
which commands.  For instance, 's' is an abbreviation for 'south' not 'say' and
sc is an abbreviation for score.
If you want to know more commands try just typing "help" by its self on a
line and press enter.  Also to find out more about commands try typing the
word "help" followed by the command for example try:
  help look
  help autoexits
For the extreem newbie and even the seasoned mudders we suggest you go through
mud school to learn how all the commands work.  In mud school you can do
everything from make your first few levels to buying a few needed items for
adventuring.
If you get stuck feel free to ask questions on the chat channel or check the
who list for a warden.

  From all the gods here at PaP we hope you have fun and wish your
  character luck as it runs into anything and everything.

202 NEWCORPSE~
Syntax: newcorpse <player> Syntax: newcorpse <player> <corpse #>
Newcorpse allows you to recreate a corpse for a player who has lost thiers. 
The player must be online in order for the corpse to be recreated.  The 5
most recent corpses will be saved.  Typing newcorpse <player> will display a
list of corpses and number of items each corpse contains The corpses will be
flagged as valid or invalid.  DO NOT recreate an invalid corpse.  The
newcorpse routine is fairly intelligent and will not save corpses containing
only one item.  Therefore if the player has died trying to get his original
corpse, and has only a light source, that corpse will not be saved.  Once
the apporiate corpses to be recreated is decided upon , typing newcorpse
<player> <corpse #> will recreate the corpse.  The corpse will be recreated
in the room in which you issued the command.  
 
~
201 PET_SHOP~
Pet Shops are one of the more tricky aspects of building, because a pet
shop requires 2 rooms in order to function correctly.  The first room is
where the person goes to buy their pet.  The second room is where the mobs
for sale are reset to.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that the second room be
the VERY NEXT VNUM after the first.  (Thus if the pet shop is room 1234,
then the second room where the pets are stored should be 1235) 
Room1: Gets the pet_shop flag. No mob is necessary but one just standing there
       pretending to be a shopkeeper adds to the reality. The mob is not a 
       shopkeeper, the room itself is the shopkeeper.
Room2: This is where you reset the mobs for sale. the mobs must have the flag
       'Pet' toggled under the act section. Prices are set by mob level.

201 OEDIT INVOKE~
Ok builders,.... here's the info you all have been waiting for.
 
While in oedit, you have the possibility to do 5 things with INVOKE.
These are set by the ac_type command.  (See help AC_TYPE)  The most 
common of these is ac_type 5, which is for casting spells. Once you set the
ac_type, you then must fill in any other information required.  For casting a
spell, you must provide a spell (help ac_setspell) and a current and maximum
charge level (help ac_v1, and ac_v2).  To change an object from the current
one to another, you must provide a second object the current one will 
transform to (help ac_vnum).  Here's a sample for invoking invis:
 
ac_type 5
ac_setspell invisibility
ac_v1 5
ac_v2 5

&RSyntax: &Bmultiburst &P<spell> <spell>&W

With this skill, a mage is able to summon enough energy within himself to

1 'HOWL OF FEAR'~
Syntax: howl <target>
&w
Faced with the bellowing howl of rage from a werewolf's towering form, most
enemies will be stricken by a sudden overwhelming feeling of fear and paralysis.
Victims effected by a werewolf's beastly howl are generally disheartened and
therefor inflict less damage with each hit and find themselves too afraid to
press their oppenent making their hits landed fewer.
~
1 'ENHANCED REFLEXES'~
Syntax: enhance
Note  : This spell is the skill equivalent of 'haste' and is not accumulative
        with it.
&w
The art of fluid movement, trained by thieves and natural to werewolves, is
displayed through either of these graceful opponent's specialized reflexes.  By
concentrating on your objective and making yourself feel one with it these
groups of men, women and beasts are able to hone their skills and speed into a
near dance of gracefully dealt death allowing them to land blows faster than the
eye can keep up with.
~
1 'RAKE EYES'~
&wSyntax: &Wrake <target>
&w
Sensing an opening in your defenses a trained werewolf will quickly
press his or her advantage by taking a swift and savage strike at your
eyes, gouging them with their sharp claws.  This attack will almost
always leave an opponent blind and wishing he'd paid closer attention,
but is not accumulative, due to it's damaging nature.
~
1 'DOUBLE BACKSTAB'~
A true master of the thieving arts might learn the skill of striking with not
one, but two backstabs.  Requiring the agility known only to a select few of the
world's adventurers, this ability demands a high mastery in the art of stealth
to slip behind someone and take them by surprise enough to land more than the
first backside blow.  Although while it has many advantages, this does leave a
thief's striking range rather short, since to strike multiple blows he must use
both hands with daggers ready.

&Wget a quest to kill a mob, or a quest to find an object. If you are assigned an
&Wobject quest, the object is placed in the room of a suitable mob according to 
&Wyour level. You must go get the object and return to the &cQuest Master&W and
&Wtype QUEST COMPLETE.  He will then take the object from you and reward you with
&Wquest points.
 
&WIf you are assigned a mob quest, you must go find the mob and kill it, then 
&Wreturn to the &cQuest Master&W and type QUEST COMPLETE.  The mob you are to kill
&Wwill have a [TARGET] flag and while you are questing you will have a [QUESTING]
&Wflag.  
 
&R --- Before you begin questing, make sure you read HELP AUTOQUEST RULES ---
 
&WThe amount of time you are given for a quest is random, and can range anywhere
&Wfrom 10-30 minutes.  Once you have completed a quest, you must wait 30 minutes 
&W-REAL- time before you can autoquest again.  If you request a quest and the
&cQuest Master&W doesn't have a quest for you, you must wait 10 minutes before
&Wtrying to quest again.
 
&WThe points you gain while questing are saved every time you log off, but don't
&Wlast forever.  Each ten levels you lose any quest points you might of gained,
&Wfor example at level 10 you would be back at 0 quest points.  So quest lots and
&Wspend your quest points! Don't forget to read &RHELP AUTOQUEST RULES.&W Anyone
&Wwho doesn't abide by the rules will have to deal with the consequences. We want
&Wthis to be enjoyable for everyone.

0 'ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE'~
&wAfter spending years training in the martial arts, many monks further enhance
their studies in hand-to-hand combat learning the makeup of the human body.
This teaches them were the weaker places of the body, including the many
"pressure points" of the body, are, allowing them to cause massive amounts of
damage with a single touch.  Use of these pressure points can often lead to a

&w(&CInformation for the Dwarven racial ability of FORGE.&w)
Due to the general sizes of many races or their physical attributes, the
forging of equipment for specific races has to be specified.  Here's a list
to the grouping of races.

1 'GOLDEN AURA'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: cast 'golden aura' <target>
&w
Masters of self-defense and healing, clerics are able to errect an aura about
themselves reducing damage by 3/4's.  This spell may be used with sanctuary
for an accumulative effect and clerics are able to offer their holy
protection to others around them, but none save a cleric is able to control
the sheer power of this magic.  Mobs & Players affected by golden aura have a
line saying: "&Y<Target> body radiates a crisp golden aura.&w" when you type look
in the same room.
(&CGolden Aura can't be invoked by any, but those with the ability to cast it.&w)

1 'SHRIEK'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: shriek  &C(While in combat)
&w
Harnessing the pure destructive power of sound, bards are able to shatter
glass in a player's inventory or even in a protected container.  The only
glass generally found on players of any value is that used in the creation of
potions, vials & flasks.
(&CAside from causing a base damage amount with each shriek, every potion that
is shattered adds an extra 10 damage, with a maximum limit of 25 potions
destroyed per shriek.&w)
&W

&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
1 'SPIT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: spit  &C(While in combat)
&w
Using their own acidic saliva, draconi have become very adept at fighting
while spiting at their opponents.  The saliva causes a fair ammount of damage
and poisons the ennemy.  On occasion, they aim their spit at the facial part
of their ennemies, thus they can hit the eyes or mouth, rendering their
opponent either blind or unable to cast spells.
&z
*&WNOTE&z*&w Spit is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "Draconi" race or 
it will not work.
&W

-1 'TRANSPORT'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: transport <item> <player>
&w
Transport was created as a convience to players so they wouldn't have to use
the auction channel to pass items between themselves when they're far apart
throughout the mud.  There are a couple things to keep in mind here though:
&z
*&w This command is for your convience, do NOT abuse it in any way.  This means
  sending tons of items to a player that does not want them and loading up
  their eq for either annoyance or PK reasons.  I don't care the reasoning
  behind it, it's not here as a new PK strategy.
&z
*&w Please ASK a player before transporting them equipment to keep misunder-
  standings from occuring.
&W
Ok, now that that's out of the way, here's how it works:
&wYou type:&g  transport quill ashin
&wYou see:&g   You transport magical quill to Ashin.
&wSent back:&g Magical quill appears magically in your hands from Ashin.
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
~
-1 AFKMES 'AFKMESSAGE'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&WSyntax&w: afkmes <message>  &C(Your name is autoput before the message.)
&w
This is just a way of customizing the messages others receive when they try
to send you tells while you're AFK (Away From the Keyboard).
&c_____________________________________________________________________________
&cYou are a &YDwarf&c and have chosen the vocation of a &YMage&c.
&RAfk Message: &rAshin &W.  &W<---- &wFound in the 'score' list.
&cYou have &Y126/20&c hit, &C140/100&c mana, &G100/100&c movement, 21 practices.
etc...
&c_____________________________________________________________________________
&wLet's keep these clean though, ok?
&BExample&w:
&WYou type&w: afkmes is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.
&cSomeone tries to tell you something...
&cSomeone sees:&Y Ashin is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.

1 'FORGE COSTS'~
&z_____________________________________________________________________________
&wWhile much of the work in a dwarf's forging is magic coming from the forger,
a good deal of supplies are needed for creation of equipment.  Here's a list
of what forging will cost you:
&WBase Cost&w: level * 10000 &Y<GOLD>  &C(level 30 = 30000, level 105 = 1050000)
&w
Due to the differences in supplies necessary for the varying magical affects
there lies extra costs within the actual making of the equipment:
&W
&B             Damroll      &W=&w 10k      &B Hitroll       &W=&w 10k
&B             Stat Raises  &W=&w 5k       &B Hp\mana\AC    &W=&w 1k
&B             Blood        &W=&w 3k       &B Anti-disarm   &W=&w 3k
&B             Saving-spell &W=&w 10k      &B Saving-breath &W=&w 10k
&B
&z*&WNOTE&z*&w "Stat Raises" are referring to str, int, wis, dex & con
&z*&WNOTE&z*&w Every listed price is set to PER affect.  Ie +5 damroll = +50k gold.

Ever the rulers of the night, vampires of medium experience are able to call
a cloaking of mist about themselves, blocking them from being seen by nearly
anything.  Moving silently behind their natural screen they're able to slip
by the various creatures of the realm without raising an alarm or approach
a victim to feed upon before anyone is aware.

~
110 DEATH2~
When you die, a corpse is made. If you are AT or UNDER LEVEL 20 it is sent
to the Morgue where you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. 
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 when you die, a corpse is made at that very spot
where death hit you. You are sent to the morgue, and from there you have to
seek out and find your corpse once again to get your equipment back.
 
All affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.
Followers and group members are not affected by your death.
Followers will stop following you upon your death (or theirs, hehe)
 
&R**&W Corpses decay over time, and so do the object IN the corpses. You have
30 MUD HOURS (15 real minutes) to seek and collect all your corpse items.
Only you or members of your group may collect things FROM your corpse.&R**

This spell is a more powerfull form of BLESS.
~
0 BLUR~
&RSyntax: &Bcast &Pblur&W

206 BODY~
&CBody Armor:&G
Body armor is split into 3 layers:
1st layer: Padded, fish and piecemeal.
2nd layer: Chain, ring and scale armor.
3rd layer: Plate and splint armor.
 
All body attacks must penetrate all 3 layers.
 
Padded, fish, chain and ring armor absorb some blunt damage and let some of it through.
Scale, plate and splint armor absorb all blunt damage, letting none through.
 
Padded, fish, chain, scale and ring armor absorb all sharp damage, letting none through.
Plate and splint armor either absorb all sharp damage or let all through.
 
All damage absorbed by armor damages it, eventually breaking the armor.
Armor can be repaired with the patch skill, or at a blacksmithy.
 
Piecemeal has a % chance to either absorb some or let all damage thru on sharp and blunt.
Piecemeal is meant for silly stuff like arrows thru the heart, dominatrix outfits, anything
that wouldn't fit under the other types and also wouldn't cover the whole torso.

To create the actual object sign:
 
&C1&W: Create the object the sign will be.
&C2&W: Make the sign type trash or furniture.
&C3&W: Decide what word will have to be typed to read the sign <ie. look (word)>
&C4&W: In the oeditor of the sign type ed add <word or words>
&C5&W: Within the text editor type in your signs message, and that's the sign.
 
&GTo create the fakie or non-object based sign do this:

&C1&W: Decide what word will have to be typed to read the sign <ie. look (word)>
&C2&W: In the reditor of the room that will contain the sign type ed add <word or words>
&C3&W: Within the text editor type in your signs message.

I don't want to see ANY shouting, yelling, chatting, oocing, musicing, or otherwise
global channel using random programs, unless I authroize it or its for a quest.
 
Random programs make this mud infinatly more fun to play and give it depth.
I want to see at least one rand prog on EVERY mobile, two is even better.

the say channel.
 
The argument needs to be explained further, for act_progs an argument might look like this:
smiles, '$n smiles at you', or '$n smiles at $N'
The apostrophies are necessary, else the program will trigger once for every word it sees
that matches one on the list.  Speech progs are similar, except that triggers are found in
the say channel instead of through socials.

Onegative: For being the only one left that bothered to contact me
concerning the condition of this mud when it seemed an impossibility.
~
-1 MUR MURDERER~
&BCriminal offense&W: Murder, first degree.
&BPsych profile&W:    Remorseless, frenzied killer.  Little or no sense of morality.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Short weapons such as small axes, knives or clubs.
 
&CMO&W:
&GOnce the murderer begins an attack, there is no stopping him/her.  Utilizing every
ounce of force and body part the murderer kicks, punches and bites his victim to death.
One noteable thing concerning the mentality of the murderer is that the loss of an arm
or leg does not phase him mentally.  In fact nothing can be done to distract the murderer
from his goal: the death of his victim.
~
-1 HER HERETIC~
&BCriminal offense&W: Heresy as defined by the MTE council of archbishops.
&BPsych profile&W:    Although passive in nature, their ideals make them dangerous.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Magic, long blunt weapons, staves, maces.
 
&CMO&W:
&GAlthough the heretic draws his power from defensive and healing magic, he is not above
calling down the wrath of his percieved god.  The upper echeleon of heretic priests
is rumored to have the ability to transform himself into a nearly invulnerable angel.
Be wary, as even though the heretic is many times seen in the backround of a fight 
aiding his allies, the heretic can surround himself with vast amounts of magical defense
making him a worthy opponenet in a fight.
~
-1 WAR WARLOCK~
&BCriminal offense&W: Use of illegal and destructive magiks.
&BPsych Profile&W:    Destructive, meglomaniacal, obsessive.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Magically enhanced daggers or staves.
 
&CMO&W:
&GThe warlock has been compared to the murderer in terms of fighting mentality.
Warlocks are generally unrelenting and frenzied when it comes to using magic
in a fight.  They are often seen shattering armor and weapons with but a thought
and some have been known to call down meteors to damage their foes.

Warlocks have also been seen in the company of huge reptilian creatures, which
leads many to suspect that the elite among the warlocks either have the ability to
summon dragons or transform themselves into dragons.
~
-1 CON CONMAN~
&BCriminal offense&W: Use of illusionary magiks to decieve or con.
&BPsych profile&W:    Decievingly friendly, mysterious, and therefore dangerous.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Enchanted wands, daggers and other short bladed weaponry. 
 
&CMO&W:
&GConmen often employ fighting techniques similar to that of a thief.
One noteable difference between a conman and a thief is that the conman
relies more heavily on defensive magic, often creating optical illusions
and even mystical mirrors which can reflect physical and magical energy.
~
-1 PAG PAGAN~
&BCriminal offense&W: Practice of a pagan religion, as defined by the MTE council of archbishops
&BPsych profile&W:    Perverse, lacks respect towards their own culture, aggressively stubborn.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Magically enhanced staves or daggers, prefers the use of wooden weapons.
 
&CMO&W:
&GPagans have a few methods through which they practice their magic and religion.
Through rune carving<tatoos> they can enhance abilities, defensive or offensive.
Pagans can manipulate wooden objects to create weapons and armor.

Utilizing natural elements they can call up vines, columns of water, or blasts of air to 
assault their victims.  Pagans also have the ability to heal wounds and even reattach lost
limbs using salves and potions.  Pagans have a natural immunity against poison and disease.
Above all of that, however, the most noteable ability of the pagans is their ability to 
embody the spirit of Gaia and become what has come to be know as a Gaiaen Paladin.

The exact abilities of the paladin are yet unknown, but what is known is that it is one of 
the strongest life forms ever encountered by a human.
~
-1 CHA CHAOMANCER~
&BCriminal offense&W: Practice of chaomancy, as defined by the MTE council of archbishops.
&BPsych profile&W:    Affinity for chaos
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Magically enhanced staves and daggers.

is dynamic and void, however, they also derive quite a few spells and abilities 
from all of the elements.
~
-1 ASN ASSASSIN~
&BCriminal offense&W: Multiple accounts of murder, first degree.
&BPsych profile&W:    Premeditated, focused.
 
&CChoice of weapon&W: Bare hands
 
&CMO&W:
&GWhile both kill, the assassin and murderer have very different styles.
Firstly, the assassin refuses to use weaponry of any kind.  This mentality goes so far as to
self-conciously prevent the assassin from using weapons, even if it might be advantageous.
That occasion rarely arises, however, as even the most unskilled assassin has the ability
to defeat many opponents before he even breaks a sweat.
 
The common assassin is characterized by the ability to focus to the point where the loss of
a limb will not even distract them from a fight.
 
While noone who has seen an assassin fight has ever lived, they are rumored to be fast
enough to redirect attacks back to the attacker, parry against bladed weapons, and even
blind, trip and mute a victim with a single blow.
~
-1 OCC OCCULTIST~
&BCriminal offense&W: Destruction of corpses, defiling of gravesites.
&BPsych profile&W:    Cultistic, affinity for death.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Short daggers, axes.
 
&CMO&W:
&GUnlike the necromancer, the defiler chooses to specialize in evil and death magic.
Many of their abilities and majiks derive from ritualistic sacrifice and the art of vodoo.
Defilers are the only peoples known to have the ability to raise the dead in any state
of decomposition, whether it be through mummification, the creating of zombies or through
animating rotten corpses or through the animating of skeletons.
 
In the respect of vodoo, vodoo dolls have been found in the possession of defilers
on many occasions, and accounts of vodoo attacks have been recorded.
~
-1 TER TERRORIST~
&BCriminal offense&W: Multiple accounts of terrorist activities, including bombings.
&BPsych profile&W:    Anti-social, pyromaniacal, affinity for demolition.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Torches, bombs, grenades.
 
&CMO&W:
&GTerrorists generally prefer indirectly defeating their foes rather than fighting them
hand to hand.  Terrorists have the knowledge and skill to create bombs which can be used
as grenades, time bombs, and door traps.  They have the ability to construct chemical,
napalm and tear gas warheads for their bombs.
 
Terrorists also have knowledge as to how to construct flame throwers, and how to bug
rooms with audio and visual devices.
~
-1 VAN VANDILIER~
&BCriminal offense&W: Expressing liberal attitude, resisting arrest, protesting.
&BPsych profile&W:    Liberal, noble, suave.
 
&CWeapon of choice&W: Light swords, staves, spears.
 
&CMO&W:
&GVandiliers are generally the most skilled fighters when it comes to swordplay.
Many vandiliers are ambidexterous when it comes to sword fighting, and many
use two swords during a fight to increase their ability to parry while attacking.
~
-1 TEC TECHNOMANCER~
&BCriminal offense&W: Blackmarket selling of techno-mantic weaponry.
&BPsych profile&W:    Anti-social, affinity for machinery.
 
&CChoice of weapon&W: Technologically enhanced objects.
 
&CMO&W:
&GTechno-mancers surround themselves with their own devices.  Many technomancers
can mount flame throwers, laser turrets, enhanced optical visors, and even chemical
injection physical enhancers into common objects to aid them in combat.
~

on the body of the victim causing great pain.
~
206 'MEDIT CONVENTIONS'~
&BMobile conventions and averages&W:
 
Hitpoint Modifier:  There is a large difference between every rung of the hp modifier.
                    average should be used for most mobs, unless u want them considerably
                    easier or harder than most mobs.
 
Skin Toughness:     There isn't a huge difference between each of these rungs
                    but you should still keep it at the middle rung for most mobs.

Spec programs:      I say don't use them unless it is spec_guard or spec_fido/janitor
                    everything else can be accomplished much more effeciently through
                    the fight_progs and hitprcnt_progs.

&CAddaffects which mimic spells:
&GHeighten senses&W:      This one shouldn't be too frequent really.

&CFor all other conventions, see the oedit <object type> help files.

bend them a little for extra rare items and the like.
~

fire and < very rarely in the heaven room > full restores of the character.

Score shows you your stats. Score also has three modes.
 
Typing &Cscore&w gets you your normal stats.
Typing &Cscore imm&w gets you your immunity stats.
Typing &Cscore mes&w gets you your message stats.
~
0 IMMUNITY~
Immunities are a large part of the combat system.  Everytime damage is
assessed, it must first be filtered through the immunity stats of the
victim.  The lower the immunity ratings, the better.  
 
For example, if you were hit with a 100 point fireball and your 
fire immunity was 100, you would recieve 100% of the damage.
 
If your immunity to fire was 0, you would recieve no damage, and
if it were -100, then you would actually recieve -100% of the
damage, which would heal you 100 points.
 
This is also how healing spells work here, healing spells are simply
damage spells that deal regen damage. Most races have -100
immunity to regen, so heal spells heal most people.
 
Some races, such as the undead ones like ghoul, would be harmed
by regen spells, or heal spells.
 
For info on the score imm display, see &Chelp immscore&X.
~
0 IMMSCORE~
The immunity display in score imm is as follows:
 
The first number is your permenant immunity, this means it wont
change except by act of warden or a mutation.
 
The second number is your temp imm, this is affected by spells
and equipment/tattoos.
 
To determine your actual immunity to something, add both the
perm immunity rating and temp immunity together.
~
1 ADDITIONS~
I converted the immunities and finished what swift started.
