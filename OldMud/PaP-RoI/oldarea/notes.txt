No its not a new skill, its something that goes along with weapon
confidence.  Everyone has a very slim chance to get a critical (*1.4
damage) strike every hit.  
 
The equation is horrible odds (if u have 100% confidence, its a less than 5% chance)
But it should add a point to the weapon confidence coding, besides the minor
hitroll it adds.

Ive coded it so mobs remember who was fighting them if they run away or die.
With this, mobs will attack the person in their memory, and also throw some
expletive phrases at them before they attack.
 
I've got 6 phrases in the coding, but if you think of any, please note them.
The phrase should be in the context of the you hurt me so now I kill you realm.
DIE BITCH DIE is a good one, stuff like that.

I fixed the typos and ideas commands so if you use the argument "clear"
with either of them, they clear the file.
 
This is with the assumption that players will use those commands
to alert us of ideas or typos.
 
Usage example: typos clear

Ok, Ive formally, and finally, removed all dodge and parry skills, these
include dodge, enhanced dodge and parry. Dodge is based on agi/dex while
parry is related to agi, dex, str, weapon confidence and a weapon length equation.
 
I also have added a skill called ripotse, it is what it is in RL, a single attack
following a well placed parry.

I've reinstated Swift's old regen coding.
This means that Heretic, pagan and occultist classes will have a variable regen.
Each will have to pray, offer a sacrifice, etc to reset their regen value to full.
With a lesser regen value, they will regen less.
However, upon resetting, the regen value jumps to 200% as opposed to the
stagnant 100% that everyone else has.
 
We will also be able to set regen ourselves to whatever as prizes or gifts
to players who do things or as war prizes etc.
Its already coded into mset as mset <victim> regen <#>
It's a direct percentage relationship to regen, so it's a value that matters
quite a bit, set yours to whatever u want, but dont make it more than 3 digits.

I've got the prototype for the shadow walk skill working.  I added both

gate(spell) will take you to their respective areas from where you can walk
to people or find gates to people as well.  
 
There will be mobs in both areas, so the propect of easy travel will

Ok, Sheaths are done.  All sheath armor now has an extra value that is
settable in oedit.  Value 8 of the object is now weapon vnum, its just like
a door and a key, every sheath can only accept one specfic object.  Every
sheath also can only hold one object at a time, like a real sheath.  I coded
the sheath and unsheath commands.  They both work perfectly, to the best of
my knowledge.  You can look in the sheath, but if one is wearing it, others
can not.  This is the point of the sheaths, to hide whatever weaponry you
might have.  Theives and Vandiliers will get auto-unsheath skills so they
can hide their weapons right up until the moment of combat.  
 
If you have any Q's, please note me.

I thought over the sheath coding I did, and realized that I ommitted
general sheaths.  IE: I made sheaths totally specific, and I felt that that
would be wrong.  I have added two more values to sheaths only armor, v6 and
v7.  Weapon type is v6, and it is the same as the weapon class for weapons. 
Weapon length is the same as weapon length for weapons.  So if you set v6 to
slash and v7 to 1(short) then only short slash weapons could fit in the
sheath.  If you set v6 and v7, set v8 to 0 please, and vice versa.
